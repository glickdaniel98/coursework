.3.3.1 
1- The color mapping is in the aes wrapper.
2- Categorical: class, manufacturer, cylinder, fuel type, model, year, cylinder, transmission
   Continuous: displacement, city, highway
   We can simply pull up the graph using view(mpg)
3- For color, giving it a continuous variable created a scale of light to dark blue for every point, not individual colors.  
   For size, it gave a different size for each item type.  
3.5.1
1-you get many different plots for each variable which isn't very helpful
4- I'd say an advantage is its clarity and pointing out differences between cars of a specific type. A disadvantege is that you cant show all the data on one graph. If you had a larger dataset it might onlu make sense to use a color dataset where you can visualize all the data on one graph  
3.6.1
5- They'll look the same. It doesnt really matter if you pass it in before or after
6-ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +   geom_point() + geom_smooth(data = filter(mpg, class == "subcompact"), se = FALSE)
3.8.1
1-overplotting. Many points overlap. You can implemet geom_jitter() to make your graph less accurate at small scales. ?
2- Width and Height; amount of vertical and horizontal Jitter.
