# Anatomy of the long tail

```{r long-tail}
# Generate the equivalent of figure 2 of this paper:
# https://5harad.com/papers/long_tail.pdf

# Specifically, for the subset of users who rated at least 10 movies, produce a plot that shows the fraction of users satisfied (vertical axis) as a function of inventory size (horizontal axis). 

#We will define "satisfied" as follows: an individual user is satisfied p% of the time at inventory of size k if at least p% of the movies they rated are contained in the top k most popular movies. As in the paper, produce one curve for the 100% user satisfaction level and another for 90%---do not, however, bother implementing the null model (shown in the dashed lines). 
#Use quantile() to get 90% line
