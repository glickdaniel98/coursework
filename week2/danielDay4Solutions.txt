----
1-T?	true bc less than alpha ?
2-F?
3-T because otherwise you would have t=0 
4-F?
5-F not enough info 
6-F?

edit: all are false


2.2
-----
a-Treatment group = 45/69 , Control group = 30/34
b-i-   H_0:The Heart translant is an effective way to help the patients.
       H_a:The Heart translant is not an effective way to help the patients.
  ii-  28, 75, 69, 34, zero, -23% 
  iii- A difference of -23% would almost never happen.

2.5
-----
a-	H_0: p_provacative = p_conservative
 	H_a: p_provacative doesn't equal p_conservative
b-	(p_provacative)-(p_conservative) = (5/20)-(15/25) = (0.25) - (0.6) = -0.35
c-	Z=(-0.35)/(0.1491)=-2.3747  (because SE = 1/sqrt(45))
  	p= 2(Z>|-2.3747|) = 0.0189 ==> smaller than 0.05 so reject H_0

-----
1- sd(active)=3, sd(inactive)=1.5, normal() n=50, 29 active, 21 inactive. Find distribution for %95?

	import(tidyverse)
	mu1 <-3.5
	sig1 <- 3
	mu2 <-3.5
	sig2 <- 1.5
	test.stat <- rep(0, 10^5)
				for(i in 1:10^5)
					{X1 <- rnorm(29,mu1,sig1)
					 X2 <- rnorm(21,mu2,sig2)
					 X1.bar <- mean(X1)
					 X2.bar <- mean(X2)
					 X1.var <- var(X1)
					 X2.var <- var(X2)
					 test.stat[i] <- (X1.bar-X2.bar)/sqrt(X1.var/29 + X2.var/21)
					}
	quantile(test.stat,c(0.025,0.975))== 2.5%: -2.025379,  97.5%: 2.017783

2-
	magnets <- read.csv("magnets.csv")
	summary(magnets)
	x1.bar <- mean(magnets$change[1:29])
	x2.bar <- mean(magnets$change[30:50])
	x1.var <- var(magnets$change[1:29])
	x2.var <- var(magnets$change[30:50])
	(x1.bar-x2.bar)/sqrt(x1.var/29 + x2.var/21) = 5.986 which is outside the interval.

##ignore everything on the bottom. I accidentally read part of the wrong textbook and answered the questions there.

2-Sleeping in college. A recent article in a college newspaper stated that college students get an average of 5.5 hours of sleep each night. A student who was skeptical about this value decided to conduct a survey by randomly sampling 25 students. On average, the sampled students slept 6.25 hours per night. Identify which value represents the sample mean and which value represents the claimed population mean.
sample mean= 6.25
pop mean= 5.5


5-Gamification and statistics, scope of inference. Researchers investigating the effects of gamification (application of game-design elements and game principles in non-game contexts) on learning statistics randomly assigned 365 college students in a statistics course to one of four groups; one of these groups had no reading exercises and no gamification, one group had reading but no gamification, one group had gamification but no reading, and a final group had gamification and reading. Students in all groups also attended lectures. The study found that gamification had a positive impact on student learning compared to traditional teaching methods involving reading exercises. (Legaki et al. 2020)

(a)Identify the population of interest and the sample in this study.

(b)Comment on whether the results of the study can be generalized to the population, and if the findings of the study can be used to establish causal relationships.
-----
(a) All college students studying statistics (365 students.) 
(b) No, because the students are selected from only 2 specific majors.
Also, the study can be used to establish casual relationships 
because it is experimenmtal.
