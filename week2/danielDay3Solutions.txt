1- 	magnets <- read.csv("magnets.csv") 	summary(magnets)  == 3.5
2- 	Factor; because it's just telling you if they got the drug or placebo. There's no real numeruic value. edit; use summary(as.factor(magnets$active))  to see results in recent R version.
3- 	mean(magnets$change[1:29])= 5.24, mean(magnets$change[30:50])= 1.10
4-	sd(magnets$change[1:29])= 3.24, sd(magnets$change[30:50])= 1.58
5-	boxplot(magnets$change[1:29])= 5.24, boxplot(magnets$change[30:50])= 1.10
	table(magnets$change[30:50]), there is one outlier in the 3 posiotion, 2 in the 4 position and one in the 5 position. There's no need to check the first half of the values because it's clear from the boxplot that their are no outliers.
