The mean shoulder girth is 108.20 cm with a standard deviation
of 10.37 cm. The mean height is 171.14 cm with a standard deviation of 9.41 cm. The correlation
between height and shoulder girth is 0.67.

(a) Write the equation of the regression line for predicting height.
	beta_1 = r(sd_h/sd_g) = 0.67(9.41/10.37) = 0.6079749
	beta_0 = y_bar-beta_1(x_bar) = 171.14-(0.6079749)(108.20) = 105.357
	y= 105.357 + 0.6079749(x)

(b) Interpret the slope and the intercept in this context.
	Slope: Every 1 cm  increase in shoulder girth results in a average height increases of 0.6079749
	Intercept: If you'd have 0cm shoulder width they'd be 105.357cm tall

(c) Calculate R^2 of the regression line for predicting height from shoulder girth, and interpret it in the context of the application.
	r=0.67 ==> r^2= 0.4489 	so %44.89 of the model is explained by the shoulder girth.

(d) A randomly selected student from your class has a shoulder girth of 100 cm. Predict the height of this student using the model.
		y= 105.357 + 0.6079749(100) = 166.154 
 
(e) The student from part (d) is 160 cm tall. Calculate the residual, and explain what this residual means.
	e=y_i-y_hat = 160 - (166.154) = -6.15449 
	There is a 6.15449 difference between  the model prediction and what was measured.

(f) A one year old has a shoulder girth of 56cm. Would it be appropriate to use this linear model to predict the height of this child?
	No. The data is based on adults. Children are not from the same population.

The scatterplot and least squares summary below show
the relationship between weight measured in kilograms and height measured in centimeters of 507
physically active individuals.

             Estimate     Std. Error 	t value     Pr(>|t|)
(Intercept)  -105.0113     7.5394  	 	-13.93	 0.0000
height 	    1.0176     0.0440 		 23.13 	 0.0000

(a) Describe the relationship between height and weight.
	There is positive correlation. As the height increases, the weight increases.
	
(b) Write the equation of the regression line. Interpret the slope and intercept in context.
	y= (1.0176)x + (-105.0113)
	Slope: Every 1 cm increase in height results in a average weight increase of 1.1076 kg.
	Intercept: If you were 0cm in height, you'd weigh -105.011 which is obviously impossible.

(c) Do the data provide strong evidence that an increase in height is associated with an increase in weight? State the null and alternative hypotheses, report the p-value, and state your conclusion.
	H_0: Beta_1=0 	H_1: Beta_1â‰ 0 	 P-value is given as 0.0000		(Beta is the slope)
	Result is significant (increase in height is associated with increase in weight) because p-value is siginificantly low.
		
(d) The correlation coefficient for height and weight is 0.72. Calculate R^2 and interpret it in context.
	r = 0.72  ==> r^2=(0.72)^2 = 0.5184 ==> The model explains %51.84 variability of the response data around its mean.
